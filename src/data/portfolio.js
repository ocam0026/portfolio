    overview:
      "Students at Algonquin College experience ongoing difficulties navigation around campus and accessing campus safety services due to fragmented information. While a campus safety app already existed, it suffered from low awareness, outdated design, and limited functionality—resulting in minimal student adoption and trust. As a result, safety resources remained difficult to access in critical moments, leaving students without reliable, real-time support when they need it most. There was a clear need for a modern, intuitive, and widely adopted solution that not only improved accessibility to emergency services but also rebuilt student confidence through proactive safety features and clear communication.",

Features such as Campus Maps and Safety Toolbox were simply links to the college website, causing user confusion and poor UX.\n\nOur team had a clear opportunity: improve the outdated UI and build intuitive safety features natively in the app rather than relying on external links.",

From there, we grouped features into logical sections so the app would feel simple and intuitive for students.",

    conclusion:
      "Although this project didn’t involve a deep dive into the UX process, as my focus was on refining my Figma skills and building a design system from scratch, it still played an important role in my UI learning journey. \n\nIt was especially memorable because I got to work on a subject I’m passionate about, which made the entire design process both engaging and enjoyable.",
